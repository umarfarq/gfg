Consider a directed graph whose vertices are numbered from 1 to n. There is an edge from a vertex i to a vertex j if and only if either j = i + 1 or j = 3 * i. The task is to find the minimum number of edges in a path from vertex 1 to vertex n.

Example :-
Input:
n = 9
Output:
2
Explanation:
Many paths are possible from 1 to 9.
Shortest one possible is,
1 -> 3 -> 9, of length 2.

Solution :-

class Solution{   
public:
    int minimumStep(int n){
        //complete the function here
        int edge=0;
        while(n!=1)
        {
            if(n%3==0)
            {
                n=n/3;
                edge++;
            }
            else
            {
                n--;
                edge++;
            }
        }
        return edge;
    }
};
