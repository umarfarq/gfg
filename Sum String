Given a string of digits, the task is to check if it is a ‘sum-string’. A string S is called a sum-string when it is broken down into more than one substring and the rightmost substring can be written as a sum of two substrings before it and the same is recursively true for substrings before it.

Example 1:
Input:
S = "12243660"
Output:
1
Explanation:
"12243660" can be broken down as {"12", "24", "36", "60"}.
We can get 60 from 24 and 36 as 24 + 36 = 60. Similarly 36 can be written as 12 + 24.

Solution:-
