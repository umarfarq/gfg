Question :-
Given a directed graph with V nodes and E edges, if there is an edge from u to v, then we will say that u depends on v. Number of Dependencies (NoD) for a node x is the total count of nodes that x depends upon. Find out the sum of number of dependencies of every node.

Example:-

Input:
V = 4
E = 4
Edges = { {0,2}, {0,3}, {1,3}, {2,3} }

Output:
4
Explanation:
For the graph in diagram, 
A depends on C and D i.e. A's NoD is 2, 
B depends on D i.e. B's NoD is 1,
C depends on D i.e. D's NoD is 1,
and D depends on none.
Hence answer -> 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4

Solution in C++ :
class Solution {
  public:
    int sumOfDependencies(vector<int> adj[], int V) {
        // code here
        int cnt=0;
        for(int i=0;i<V;i++)
            cnt+=adj[i].size();
        return cnt;
    
    }
};
