Question:-Print a sequence of numbers starting with N, without using loop, where replace N with N - 5, until N > 0. After that replace N with N + 5 until N regains its initial value.

Example:- 
Input: 
N = 16
Output: 
16 11 6 1 -4 1 6 11 16
Explaination: 
The value decreases until it is greater than 0. After that it increases and stops when it becomes 16 again.

Solution in C++:-
class Solution{
public:
        // code here
            vector<int> pattern(int N){
        // code here
        vector<int> v;
        int k=N;
        while(k>0){
        v.push_back(k);
        k-=5;
        }
        v.push_back(k);
        k+=5;
        while(k<=N){
        v.push_back(k);
        k+=5;
        }
        return v;
    }
    };
